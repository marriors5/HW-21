            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Summary</h4>
            <img id="Titleimg" src="../HW 18/Images/Project Covers/Save A Pet Cover.jpg">
            <p>We focused on a local non-profit organization focused around adopting shelter animals that deserve a second chance at life.
                <br> They are a dog-focused rescue that take them away from being victims of high-kill shelters. Unfortunately their website is out of date and my group and I came in, wondering how can we modernize the website while focusing on the aims
                of our foundation.
                <br> Our team was made of 4 people, I was involved in getting a little bit of research and ideation, I went out into the field to understand more about the organization and creating protoypes at the base level in which we elevated them.
                We've used Figma, Miro, Otter.io, Discord, Slack, Zoom, Lightroom, and a camera
                <br>It was in a tight 3 week stretch, scope had to change in the middle of our project because we realized that we were focusing on the adoption process but we admitted that we were surrendering that to Petfinder. We had to switch focus
                to the organization itself and motivate more involvement with visitors to be involved with the foundation
            </p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Research</h4>
            <img class="researchimg" src="../HW 21/Images/Affinity diagram.PNG">
            <p>We did 5 user interviews that my group members conducted, I just synthesize the information into their groups, since originally we did our research based off of the adoption process, it was messy later on to use that research We created Bryan
                at first, expecting this to be aimed towards families, especially with the father as the head. After doing the tests, we shifted it more so to a more professional feeling, we didn't focus too much on a persona since we have developed the
                concept that people get dogs due to companionship.</p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Ideation</h4>
            <p>Well we wanted to create a better, more simplified way for our members to get information in a coherent pattern. With our stakeholder, Anna, the founder of the foundation, she does state that she wants to promote more volunteers and donation
                based actions to support the organization. </p>

            <p>We created a flow to simplify the process, our low fidelity was based off the mobile concept for their website since they didnt have one. We drove home with the "Mobile-first" focus
                <br> I went out into the field, primarily I targeted the volunteers that are part of the organization. I checked and gauged their opinions about our mobile prototype. I noticed that in the younger generation user, they had some difficulty
                in figuring out where to go when I asked them to navigate our mobile browser. It told me a way to simplify our navigation or make it more accessible for first glances.

        <p>We considered how their current website design fooled us as it has fooled oithers thinking that it is about adopting animals and that would be the end of it but why would they use Petfinder if that was their purpose. With what Anna has stated,
            we had to relook at the way we saw the site and change the scope in order to be more targeted in giving information about the organization. I suppose a concept that would be interesting is to have a Petfinder catalogue in the webpage so the
            user doesn't have to leave in order to see what animals the foundation has</p>
